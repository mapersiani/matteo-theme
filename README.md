# Matteo's Themes

## Themes

- Dark: A modern and customizable theme for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), designed to enhance your editor. This theme is perfect for users who want a sleek, comfortable design. I use non-vibrant colors to avoid eye strain, allowing you to work longer.
- Darkish:
- Light:

## Features

- **Customizable**: There are a couple different themes to choose from with more on the way!
